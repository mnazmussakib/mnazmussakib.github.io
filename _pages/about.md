Hello ! I'm second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu/). I have been working as a Graduate Assistant since I had joined this program. I am advised by [Dr. Sanorita Dey](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~sanorita/). 

My research interest consists of Computational Social Science, Social NLP and Responsible AI. **I would love to collaborate on interesting research work in these fields.** 

Previously, I have completed my Bachelor of Science from Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. I have a two years of work experience as a front-end developer mostly using Angular framework.
